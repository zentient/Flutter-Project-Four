### ~ Project Purposes ℹ️ 

```sh
In this fourth module, we had two objectives:
```

* Learn how to dynamically render components using a `Widget` type function (optional, it could also have been `Expanded` type), string interpolation & named parameters.

* Using the `audioplayers: ^0.17.0` Flutter package, learn how to play sounds on the app once firing the `onPressed` (@required) event on the xylophone keys.

```sh
Used widgets to create this application:
```

  - Expanded()
  - FlatButton()
  - Column()
